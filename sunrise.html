      <h1>Sunrise generator</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Everyone loves a sunrise, but everyone also loves a decent lie-in. This paradox needed a solution, and so I decided to make a Sunrise Generator, so you can enjoy a beautiful sunrise any time of day, and save it to use as wallpaper.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        This self-initiated project was also the perfect chance for me to learn more about image pixel-array manipulation and working with colour.

      <h3>Colour Interpolation</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted to create a abstract gradient result which had the random striped progression you see in the sky when the sun rises.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create this effect I first wrote a method which would <i>linearly interpolate</i> between two colours, and then for each row, instead of adding the same control value each time (to make a smooth gradient), I use a new <i>random number</i> for each row, which is usually a <i>plus</i> jump towards the end colour, but can also sometimes move backwards towards the original colour with a <i>minus</i>. Some rows also have a larger colour jump than others.
      </p>

      <h3>Noise</h3>
      <p>
        To create a less ‘digital’ and softer feel to the image, I then added some <i>noise</i> to the image by looping through the pixel array of the canvas and adding or subtracting from the R, G and B values. I had noticed when looking at reference photos that <i>noise tended to be higher in lighter areas</i>, and so I added some logic which took this into account and turned down noise on darker pixels.
      </p>
      <div class="imageWrapper"><img src="images/sunrise_3.jpg"></div>
      <h3>Randomisation</h3>
      <p>
        On each new sunrise, all the <i>values and colours</i> (colour-picked from sunrise photos) are <i>randomised</i> so the effect is different each time. I spent a lot of time experimenting with different colours and min/max values for the random numbers until I hit the sweet-spot.

      <h3>First Version in Processing</h3>
      <p>
        I made my first version of the Sunrise Generator in late 2013 as an exercise to learn about working with and manipulating pixel-arrays in <i>Processing</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I experimented a lot with different pattern-making techniques before the Sunrise Generator, and although I got results I was happy with, it was very slow and limited.

      <h3>Rebuilding in JavaScript on Canvas</h3>
      <p>
        In summer 2014 I decided to revisit the Sunrise Generator and rebuild it from scratch in <i>JavaScript on Canvas</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I simplified and refined some of the techniques I had developed, and built upon the idea to create a website containing the Sunrise Generator. Every second a new sunrise is made, and visitors can <i>save the sunrise as an image</i> to use as a wallpaper.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to generate new sunrises quickly, to encourage the impulse of <i>clicking-to-save</i> when you see one which instantly speaks to you. But when it's gone, it's gone.
