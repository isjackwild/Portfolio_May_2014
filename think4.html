      <h1>THINK4 D&AD STUDENT WINNER</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        This project was for a Channel 4 brief in the D&AD Student Awards 2012, in which we were awarded a Best of Year award for our work. The brief was to launch a new TV channel for over 60’s who enjoy quality TV. It was our job to come up with the concept, name, identity, and launch campaign for the new channel.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        I worked with Julien Donck, Alexander Venndt, Markus Dahlbom & Sebastian Hogland.

      <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>
        We started the project by doing extensive research around Channel 4. We also interviewed and researched around the target audience for the new channel. From this we found our guiding principles for the project &mdash; “Our audience want to be shown, not told, they don't want to be patronised, and most importantly they don't want to be sectioned off as ‘old people’”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on these insights, we then developed the concept that our channel wouldn't be for ‘old people’, it would be a channel for ‘thinking people’, and so Think4 was born.

       <h3>VISUAL IDENTITY</h3>
      <p>
        One of my main roles, other than Concept Development, was to create the Visual Identity for the channel. I developed a logo based on an ‘impossible puzzle’, paired with a calm and clear colour-scheme and layout system. I also created the on-screen motion-graphics, based upon the form of the logo.
