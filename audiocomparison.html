      <h1>Audio Comparison Prototype</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        I was briefed to create a prototype of a web-app which would compare an original extract from a song against the users attempt to match it. The app was to run in Chrome and to make use of the Web Audio API and getUserMedia.
      </p>

      <h3>Requirements and research</h3>
      <p>  
      Before starting work on the logic, I spent time researching different techniques used for audio analysis, sound production principles, and the Web Audio API. In this case, the important factors to compare were the <i>average amplitude</i> and the <i>rhythm</i> of the users attempt. The frequency was less important, as in theory we wanted users to be able to use any instrument they wanted.
      </p>
      <h3>First Approach: waveform overlay</h3>
      <p>
        My first approach was to plot out the average amplitude waveforms of each piece of audio <i>semi-transparent</i> on top of eachother on a canvas element. Once the two pieces of audio had been plotted the canvas contents were saved as a new image, and the pixel array was looped through to compare how many <i>semi-transparent pixels (mis-matches) there were against opaque (matched) pixels.</i> Fully transparent pixels were ignored.
      </p>
      <div class="imageWrapper"><img src="images/audio_pixels_pass.jpg"></div>
      <p class="caption">Lots of opaque pixels compared to semi-transparent. Pass!</p>
      <div class="imageWrapper"><img src="images/audio_pixels_fail.jpg"></div>
      <p class="caption">Too many semi-transparent pixels compared to opaque pixels. Fail!</p>
      <p>
        This approach was effective, however after a few tests it quickly became apparent that it did not allow for enough margin of error. It worked well for comparing two very similar pieces of audio (for example a mastered cover-version or distorted version against a mastered-original), but for our purposes, it was too precise.
      </p>

      <h3>Second approach: Beat matching</h3>
      <p>
        The second approach I worked on (with guidance from my Technical Director, Felix Neilsen) worked by <i>counting the number of peaks</i> in each piece of audio. This worked, but was inprecise, as it only went off the number of peaks, even if the rhythm was totally wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this problem, a second check was added, which took into the account <i>the time at which the peaks were recognised</i>. If enough peaks were close enough in time to peaks in the original, the attempt would pass.
      </p>
      <div class="imageWrapper"><img src="images/audio_beats_pass.jpg"></div>
      <p class="caption">Smoke On The Water vs. Smoke On The Water (cover). Pass!</p>
      <div class="imageWrapper"><img src="images/audio_beats_fail.jpg"></div>
      <p class="caption">Smoke On The Water vs. (Can't Get No) Satisfaction. Sorry, Fail!</p>
      <h3>Audio-cleanup</h3>
      <p>
        After a few tests, it became clear there there were issues regarding capturing audio from the users typically low-quality microphones. Due to factors such as background noise and bad acoustics, the comparison would often fail even though the correct rhythm was played.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this problem I added some logic which ‘cleaned-up’ the mic-input before it went to the analyser. Firstly I added a <i>Dynamics Compressor</i> which boosts lower amplitudes and brings down peaks. This helps to generally improve the quality of the audio and makes a fuller sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then added a <i>Band-Filter</i> which filters out frequencies which are out of the expected range. This means that for example, if an ambulance drove past this would be ignored. Finally I added some logic which <i>ignored any sounds under a amplitude threshold</i>, which meant that sounds such as quiet background talking or echos were ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the addition of these techniques, the accuracy was greatly improved.
