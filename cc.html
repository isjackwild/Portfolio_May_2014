      <h1>CREATIVE CODING REDESIGN</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Creative Coding is an online resource aimed at inspiring people to be more creative with code. It is run by Studio Nand in Berlin, and began as a place to put content from Nand's Processing workshops. I worked with Nand to develop the resource further.
      </p>

      <h3>Paper Prototyping and Wireframing</h3>
      <p>
        At the start of the project I did extensive paper-prototyping to develop the layout and UX of the site. I developed a module-based system for the homepage, and took inspiration from index-cards to create a consistant left-panel accross the whole site, which displays the most important meta-data.

      <h3>Mockups and web prototyping</h3>
      <p>
        Once the wireframes were made, I started to work on the design. Initial design mock-ups were made, and then I built a prototype of the site on <i>Bootstrap</i>. This allowed me to <i>design in code</i>, which is how I like to work best on this kind of project. It also helped me to design for mobile and desktop at the same time.

       <h3>TYPOGRAPHY AND VISUAL DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the content of Creative Coding, clarity of information was key, so a lot of emphasis was put on typography, spacing and use of white space so that large blocks of text were clear to read and not overfacing. It was very important that the site was inspiring, so I spent a lot of time exploring colour schemes and imagery. I also worked on an interactive logotype in <i>Processing</i>.
